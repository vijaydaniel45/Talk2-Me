# lil-http-terminator ðŸ¦¾

Gracefully terminates HTTP(S) server.

This module was forked from the amazing [http-terminator](https://github.com/gajus/http-terminator). The important changes:

- Zero dependencies, 11 KB on your disk. The original `http-terminator` brings in more than 20 sub-dependencies, >450 files, 2 MB total.
- Removed TypeScript and a dozen of supporting files, configurations, etc. No more code transpilation.
- Simpler API. Now you do `require("lil-http-terminator")({ server });` to get a terminator object.
- The termination never throws. You don't want to handle unexpected exceptions during your server shutdown.
- Termination won't hang forever if server never closes the port because some browsers disrespect `connection:close` header.

## Behaviour

When you call [`server.close()`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_close_callback), it stops the server from accepting new connections, but it keeps the existing connections open indefinitely. This can result in your server hanging indefinitely due to keep-alive connections or because of the ongoing requests that do not produce a response. Therefore, in order to close the server, you must track creation of all connections and terminate them yourself.

`lil-http-terminator` implements the logic for tracking all connections and their termination upon a timeout. `lil-http-terminator` also ensures graceful communication of the server intention to shutdown to any clients that are currently receiving response from this server.

## API

```js
const HttpTerminator = require("lil-http-terminator");

const terminator = HttpTerminator({
    server, // required. The node.js http server object instance
    
    // optional
    gracefulTerminationTimeout: 1000, // optional, how much time we give "keep-alive" connections to close before destryong them
    maxWaitTimeout: 30000, // optional, termination will return {success:false,code:"TIMED_OUT"} if it takes longer than that
    logger: console, // optional, default is `global.console`. If termination goes wild the module might log about it using `logger.warn()`.
});

// Do not call server.close(); Instead call this:
const { success, code, message, error } = await terminator.terminate();
if (!success) {
    if (code === "TIMED_OUT") console.log(message); 
    if (code === "SERVER_ERROR") console.error(message, error); 
    if (code === "INTERNAL_ERROR") console.error(message, error); 
}
```

## Usage

Use the terminator when node.js process is shutting down.

```js
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer();

const httpTerminator = require("lil-http-terminator")({ server });

async function shutdown(signal) {
    console.log(`Received ${signal}. Shutting down.`)
    const { success, code, message, error } = await httpTerminator.terminate();
    console.log(`HTTP server closure result: ${success} ${code} ${message} ${error || ""}`);
    process.exit(0);
}

process.on("SIGTERM", shutdown); // used by K8s, AWS ECS, etc.
process.on("SIGINT", shutdown); // Atom, VSCode, WebStorm or Terminal Ctrl+C
```

## Alternative libraries

There are several alternative libraries that implement comparable functionality, e.g.

- https://github.com/gajus/http-terminator (origin of this module)
- https://github.com/hunterloftis/stoppable
- https://github.com/thedillonb/http-shutdown
- https://github.com/tellnes/http-close
- https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/http-graceful-shutdown

The main benefit of `lil-http-terminator` is that:

- it does not have any dependencies
- it never throws any errors but resolves an object: `{success:Boolean, code:String, message:String, error?:Error}`.
- it never hangs if server can't be closed because of bad browser behaviour. Returns `{success:false,code:"TIMED_OUT"}`.
- it does not monkey-patch Node.js API
- it immediately destroys all sockets without an attached HTTP request
- it allows graceful timeout to sockets with ongoing HTTP requests
- it properly handles HTTPS connections
- it informs connections using keep-alive that server is shutting down by setting a `connection: close` header
- it does not terminate the Node.js process

## FAQ

### What is the use case for lil-http-terminator?

To gracefully terminate a HTTP server.

We say that a service is gracefully terminated when service stops accepting new clients, but allows time to complete the existing requests.

There are several reasons to terminate services gracefully:

- Terminating a service gracefully ensures that the client experience is not affected (assuming the service is load-balanced).
- If your application is stateful, then when services are not terminated gracefully, you are risking data corruption.
- Forcing termination of the service with a timeout ensures timely termination of the service (otherwise the service can remain hanging indefinitely).
