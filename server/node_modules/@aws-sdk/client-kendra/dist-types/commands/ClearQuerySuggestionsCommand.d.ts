/**
 * <p>Clears existing query suggestions from an index.</p>
 *          <p>This deletes existing suggestions only, not the queries
 *             in the query log. After you clear suggestions, Amazon Kendra learns
 *             new suggestions based on new queries added to the query log
 *             from the time you cleared suggestions. If you do not see any
 *             new suggestions, then please allow Amazon Kendra to collect
 *             enough queries to learn new suggestions.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <code>ClearQuerySuggestions</code> is currently not supported in the
 *             Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US-West) region.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { KendraClient, ClearQuerySuggestionsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-kendra"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { KendraClient, ClearQuerySuggestionsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-kendra"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new KendraClient(config);
 * const input = { // ClearQuerySuggestionsRequest
 *   IndexId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new ClearQuerySuggestionsCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param ClearQuerySuggestionsCommandInput - {@link ClearQuerySuggestionsCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link ClearQuerySuggestionsCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link ClearQuerySuggestionsCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link ClearQuerySuggestionsCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link KendraClientResolvedConfig | config} for KendraClient's `config` shape.
